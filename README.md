# KotH
## Utility functions for creating multi-language KotHs (controller must be Python)
Feel free to use this for what you want (within GNU GPL 3), but I am creating 
it for [Programming Puzzles and Code Golf](codegolf.stackexchange.com), a Stack 
Exchange website. This is very much a work in progress, in fact I've barely 
started, so please feel free to make feature requests. I am [Artemis Fowl](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/80756/artemis-fowl).

I decided to make this because from my limited experience of PPCG, it seems
like every time someone wants to run a King of the Hill challenge, they have
to make a controller containing largely similar things. This can be very time 
consuming, and potentially make people unwilling to run these extremely fun
challenges. This aims to make writing controllers a bit more easy, and I plan
on promoting it via community adverts once it is in a usable state.
